# Usage

Upon entering the Recipes screen, the user can search for recipes by typing into the search bar at the top.

To add a new recipe, press the floating button at the bottom-right corner, which will open a modal form. After entering the corresponding details and saving it, the new recipe will be added to the list.

Each recipe is displayed as a card with its name, description, and a "Ver detalles" link. Clicking this link navigates to the recipe details screen, where more information about the recipe can be viewed.

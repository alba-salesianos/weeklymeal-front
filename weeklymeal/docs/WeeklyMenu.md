# Usage

Upon first entering the app, the "Crear Nuevo Menu" button will be disabled until the user has uploaded a minimum of 7 recipes, as the generator needs them to create a menu without repeating recipes within one week.

Just like the one in the Homepage, once it's availabe a modal will appear that will allow the user to choose between custom menu or a default one.

On the Weekly Menu page, the user can view their weekly menu, edit it by selecting and replacing recipes, and create a new menu. Details of the recipes will be shown by pressing on each recipe when not in edit mode.
